## iOS App using SPM's + Clean Architecture and MVVM

iOS Project implemented with Clean Layered Architecture and MVVM. (Can be used as Template project by replacing item name “Movie”). **More information in medium post**: <a href="https://tech.olx.com/clean-architecture-and-mvvm-on-ios-c9d167d9f5b3">Medium Post about Clean Architecture + MVVM</a>

## The Clean Architecture

This sample project is inspired on [The Clean Architecture](https://8thlight.com/blog/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) by Uncle Bob.

Its main goal is to follow the [SOLID principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) in order to keep the software well organised, testable, easy to maintain and more importantly easy to extend/change.

As explained in the posts above and in [the book](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Architecture-Craftsmans-Software-Structure/dp/0134494164), databases, network clients and frameworks are abstracted in the upper layers (Entities, Data and Domain layers) and should not be imported/referenced into them, instead they should be injected in the App level as dependencies through the interfaces exposed by the upper layers.

## Modules

In this sample app we have the following modules/layers:

### DependencyAssembly

Framework responsible for linking the Interfaces to the `Factories`. This should only the referenced/used in the `App Module`.

### Entities

Top level module. This should not have access to any other module in the system and must be the simplest possible.

### Data

Responsible for exposing a few Interfaces for external plugins implementations such as databases, memory caches, network, bluetooth, etc. This should not reference any concrete class related to these. It also contains the `Repositories` which are another abstraction for the use of the plugins mentioned above. This module can only access `Entities` layer, nothing else.

### Domain

This module exposes `UseCases` to process business logic using the [Command Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_pattern). The use cases must be simple and have only one responsibility. They usually communicate with `Repositories` from the `Data layer` through Interfaces. Ideally `UseCases` would return `DataStructures` instead of `Entities` to the lower layers, since these could contain UI-specific data which isn't part of the `Entities` layer.

![Alt text](README_FILES/clean-architecture.png?raw=true "Clean Architecture Layers")

## Layers
* **Domain Layer** = Entities + Use Cases + Repositories Interfaces
* **Data Repositories Layer** = Repositories Implementations + API (Network) + Persistence DB
* **Presentation Layer (MVVM)** = ViewModels + Views

## App

In this layer we have all the code that's specific to the platform of development. In this sample project the platform is iOS, furthermore a concrete implementation of the `CacheInterface` exposed by the `Data layer` was implemented in the `App layer` using `UserDefaults` as the persistence choice, for example.
This layer may have `ViewModels`, `Coordinators`, `ViewControllers`, `Views`, third party frameworks and, finally, is also responsible for setting up the dependency graph for the project by linking all the interfaces to their respective concrete classes.

## Tests

For the Tests we have also isolated them for each layer. Where we have the data tests, the domain tests and finally the Presentation data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Xcode 15.0.1
- iOS 17
- Swift 5.9

### Installing

The project uses Swift Package Manager for dependency management. Just open `RandomUser.xcodeproj`, select the target `RandomUser` target and run it.

For testing just only have to run:

- DataTest
- DomainTest
- Presentation Test
